## About the package

Learning and using network analysis tools in R can be challenging.
There are so many great packages, all with their own offerings and advantages, 
but also all with their own vocabulary, syntax, 
and expected formats for data inputs and analytic outputs.
Moreover, many of these packages only work on _some_ types of networks
(usually one-mode, simple, directed or undirected networks);
if you have a different type of network, a different package is needed.
Lastly, even packages with excellent graphical capabilities
can make visualising networks slow and cumbersome by using poor defaults
and many, incomprehensible options to change them.
`{manynet}` aims to help researchers with Making, Manipulating, and Mapping networks.

## Making

First, `{manynet}` provides a set of tools that can be used to make networks in any number of common formats.
Networks can come from many sources, some can be imported from outside R, some can be found in this or other packages and coerced into some common format, and many types of networks can be created or generated using functions in this package.

#### Inventing network data

`{manynet}` includes algorithms for making networks with particular properties.
The `create_*` group of functions create networks with a particular structure,
and will always create the same format from the same inputs,
e.g.:

- `r list_functions("^create_")`

The `generate_*` group of functions generate networks from
generative mechanisms that may include some random aspect, 
and so will return a different output each time they are run,
e.g.:

- `r list_functions("^generate_")`

Note that all these functions can create directed or undirected,
one-mode or two-mode networks.
Some of these wrap existing algorithms in other packages,
while others are unique offerings or only offered for particular formats of network data,
e.g. two-mode networks, here.

#### Importing network data

`{manynet}` offers a number of options
for importing network data found in other repositories.
Besides importing and exporting to Excel edgelists and nodelists,
there are specific routines included for 
[UCINET](http://www.analytictech.com/archive/ucinet.htm), 
[Pajek](http://mrvar.fdv.uni-lj.si/pajek/),
and [DynetML](http://casos.cs.cmu.edu/projects/dynetml/) files, e.g.:

```{r import-graph, echo = FALSE, dpi = 300, fig.height=2.5}
imports <- igraph::graph_from_literal(ucinet:pajek+--+tidygraph,
                                      matrix:dynetml--+tidygraph,
                                      edgelist:nodelist+--+tibble)
imports <- imports %>% mutate(type = ifelse(node_names(imports)%in% c("tidygraph","tibble"), TRUE, FALSE))
autographr(imports, node_size = 2, layout = "hierarchy")
```

- `r list_functions("^read_")`
- `r list_functions("^write_")`

#### Coercing network data

There is also a lot of network data in addition to analytic functions that already reside in various packages in R.
Once network data is in R,
`{manynet}`'s `as_*()` functions can be used to translate objects 
from one of the above classes into any other, and include:

```{r coercion-graph, echo = FALSE, dpi = 300}
autographr(igraph::graph_from_literal(edgelist:matrix:igraph:network:tidygraph+--+edgelist:matrix:igraph:network:tidygraph,
                                      edgelist:matrix:igraph:network:tidygraph--+graphAM,
                                      igraph--+siena,
                                      siena:goldfish--+edgelist:matrix:igraph:network:tidygraph:graphAM),
           "circle", node_size = 2)
```

These functions are designed to be as intuitive and lossless as possible,
outperforming many other class-coercion packages.

We use these functions internally in every `{manynet}` function to 
(1) allow them to be run on any compatible network format
and (2) use the most efficient algorithm available.
This makes `{manynet}` compatible with your existing workflow,
whether you use base R matrices or edgelists as data frames, 
[`{igraph}`](https://igraph.org/r/),
[`{network}`](https://statnet.org), or 
[`{tidygraph}`](https://tidygraph.data-imaginist.com/index.html),
and extensible by developments in those other packages too.

## Manipulating

`{manynet}`'s `to_*()` functions can be used on any class object 
to reformat, transform, or split networks into networks with other properties, e.g.:

- `r list_functions("^to_")`

### Reformatting

Reformatting means changing the format of the network,
e.g. from directed to undirected via `to_undirected()`.

### Transforming

Transforming means changing the dimensions of the network,
e.g. from a two-mode network to a one-mode projection via `to_mode1()`.

### Splitting and Joining

Splitting means separating a network,
e.g. from a whole network to the various ego networks via `to_egos()`.

#### Changing network data

Those functions that split a network into a list of networks are
distinguishable as those `to_*()` functions that are named in the plural.

### Extracting

`{manynet}` offers a range of measures and models with sensible defaults.
Many wrap existing functions in common packages for use with one-mode networks,
but extend these to treat and/or normalise for two-mode (and sometimes three-mode) networks correctly.
Functions are given intuitive and succinct names that avoid conflicts 
with existing function names wherever possible.

`{manynet}`'s `*is_*()` functions offer fast logical tests of various network properties.
These can be used to create new 

- `r list_functions("^is_")`


## Mapping

`{manynet}` includes three one-line graphing functions with sensible defaults based on 
the network's properties.
`autographr()` is used to graph networks in any of the `{manynet}` formats.
It includes sensible defaults so that researchers can view their network's structure
or distribution with a minimum of fuss.
`{manynet}` uses the excellent `{ggraph}` package (and thus `{ggplot2}`)
as a plotting engine.
This also makes extending and theming default output easy,
and `{patchwork}` is used to help arrange individual plots together.

There are two other graphing functions too.
`autographs()` is used to graph multiple networks together,
which can be useful for ego networks or network panels.
`autographd()` is used to graph dynamic networks.

In addition, `{manynet}` offers some additional layout algorithms for
snapping layouts to a grid or 
visualising partitions horizontally, vertically, or concentrically.
The following figures illustrate the difference in results over `{igraph}`:

```{r layout-comparison, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, dpi = 300}
library(manynet)
library(igraph)
library(gridBase)
library(grid)

par(mfrow=c(1, 2), mai = c(0,0,0.5,0))
plot(as_igraph(ison_southern_women), layout = layout_as_bipartite, main = "{igraph} bipartite")
## the last one is the current plot
plot.new()              ## suggested by @Josh
vps <- baseViewports()
pushViewport(vps$figure) ##   I am in the space of the autocorrelation plot
vp1 <-plotViewport(c(1.8,1,0,1)) ## create new vp with margins, you play with this values 
p <- autographr(ison_southern_women, "hierarchy") + ggtitle("{manynet} layout")
print(p,vp = vp1) 
```

provide a common set of tools that can be used to import, export, create, and manipulate network data in a wide variety of formats,
and obtain a good first visualisation quickly.
This can be useful for pedagogical purposes, initial description, or checking something part way through the modelling process.
Through the most comprehensive network class-coercion available,
users can access routines not available in their chosen package or even in `{manynet}`.

`{manynet}` provides a common set of tools and a standard syntax for analysing many different types of networks.
It offers a broad range of functions to make, manipulate, map, measure, and model:

- one-, two-, and sometimes three-mode networks
- undirected, directed, and sometimes complex networks
- unweighted, weighted, and sometimes signed networks

## Installation

### Stable

The easiest way to install the latest stable version of `{manynet}` is via CRAN.
Simply open the R console and enter:

`install.packages('manynet')`

You can then begin to use `{manynet}` by loading the package:

`library(manynet)`

This will load any required packages and make the data contained within the package available.
The version from CRAN also has all the vignettes built and included.
You can check them out with:

`vignettes(package = "manynet")`

### Development

For the latest development version, 
for slightly earlier access to new features or for testing,
you may wish to download and install the binaries from Github
or install from source locally.

The latest binary releases for all major OSes -- Windows, Mac, and Linux -- 
can be found [here](https://github.com/snlab-ch/manynet/releases/latest).
Download the appropriate binary for your operating system,
and install using an adapted version of the following commands:

- For Windows: `install.packages("~/Downloads/manynet_winOS.zip", repos = NULL)`
- For Mac: `install.packages("~/Downloads/manynet_macOS.tgz", repos = NULL)`
- For Unix: `install.packages("~/Downloads/manynet_linuxOS.tar.gz", repos = NULL)`

To install from source the latest main version of `{manynet}` from Github, 
please install the `{remotes}` or `{devtools}` package from CRAN and then:

- For latest stable version: 
`remotes::install_github("snlab-ch/manynet", build_vignettes = TRUE)`
- For latest development version: 
`remotes::install_github("snlab-ch/manynet@develop", build_vignettes = TRUE)`

## Relationship to other packages

This package aims to provide an updated, and more comprehensive replacement for `{intergraph}`.
It also builds upon but makes some different decisions to the excellent `{tidygraph}` package.
It builds upon `{igraph}` especially, as well as `{network}`,
but works equally well with basic edgelists and matrices.

It works with and builds upon many popular network analytic packages,
such as `{igraph}` and `{network}`.

`{manynet}` inherits core functionality from the `{migraph}` package.
For more analytic and modelling functions, please see `{migraph}`.

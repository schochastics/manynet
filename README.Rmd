## About the package

`{manynet}` provides a common set of tools and a standard syntax for analysing many different types of networks.
It offers a broad range of functions to make, manipulate, map, measure, and model:

- one-, two-, and sometimes three-mode networks
- undirected, directed, and sometimes complex networks
- unweighted, weighted, and sometimes signed networks

<img style="border:10px solid white;" src="https://jameshollway.com/media/9781108833509pvs01.jpg" align="left" width="125"/>

The package is intended as a software companion to the book:

> David Knoke, Mario Diani, James Hollway, and Dimitris Christopoulos (2021) [*Multimodal Political Networks*](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/multimodal-political-networks/43EE8C192A1B0DCD65B4D9B9A7842128).
Cambridge University Press: Cambridge.

Most datasets used in the book are included in this package,
and the package implements most methods discussed in the book.
Since many of theses datasets and routines are discussed and analysed more there,
if you like the package please check out the book, and vice versa.

## How does migraph help?

`{migraph}` can help with many network analytic tasks,
including Making and Manipulating network data,
Marking and Measuring nodes, ties, and networks,
calculating Motifs and identifying Memberships,
as well as Modelling and Mapping.

### Making network data

#### Importing network data

`{manynet}` offers a number of options
for importing network data found in other repositories.
`{manynet}` can import and export to Excel edgelists and nodelists,
[UCINET](http://www.analytictech.com/archive/ucinet.htm), 
[Pajek](http://mrvar.fdv.uni-lj.si/pajek/),
and [DynetML](http://casos.cs.cmu.edu/projects/dynetml/) files, e.g.:

```{r import-graph, echo = FALSE, dpi = 300, fig.height=3}
imports <- igraph::graph_from_literal(ucinet:pajek+--+tidygraph,
                                      matrix:dynetml--+tidygraph,
                                      edgelist:nodelist+--+tibble)
imports <- imports %>% mutate(type = ifelse(node_names(imports)%in% c("tidygraph","tibble"), TRUE, FALSE))
autographr(imports,
           "hierarchy", node_size = 2)
```

- `r list_functions("^read_")`
- `r list_functions("^write_")`

#### Inventing network data

`{manynet}` includes algorithms for making networks with particular properties.
The `create_*` group of functions create networks with a particular structure,
e.g.:

- `r list_functions("^create_")`

The `generate_*` group of functions generate networks from particular
generative mechanisms, e.g.:

- `r list_functions("^generate_")`

Note that all these functions work to create two-mode networks
as well as one-mode versions.

### Manipulating network data

In addition to functions that help add elements to or extract elements from 
a network, `{manynet}` also includes functions for coercing and changing network data.

#### Coercing network data

Once network data is in R,
`{manynet}`'s `as_*()` functions can be used to translate objects 
from one of the above classes into any other, and include:

```{r coercion-graph, echo = FALSE, dpi = 300}
autographr(igraph::graph_from_literal(edgelist:matrix:igraph:network:tidygraph+--+edgelist:matrix:igraph:network:tidygraph,
                                      edgelist:matrix:igraph:network:tidygraph--+graphAM,
                                      igraph--+siena,
                                      siena:goldfish--+edgelist:matrix:igraph:network:tidygraph:graphAM),
           "circle", node_size = 2)
```

These functions are designed to be as intuitive and lossless as possible,
outperforming many other class-coercion packages.

We use these functions internally in every `{manynet}` function to 
(1) allow them to be run on any compatible network format
and (2) use the most efficient algorithm available.
This makes `{manynet}` compatible with your existing workflow,
whether you use base R matrices or edgelists as data frames, 
[`{igraph}`](https://igraph.org/r/),
[`{network}`](https://statnet.org), or 
[`{tidygraph}`](https://tidygraph.data-imaginist.com/index.html),
and extensible by developments in those other packages too.

#### Changing network data

`{manynet}`'s `to_*()` functions can be used on any class object 
to reformat, transform, or split networks into networks with other properties, e.g.:

- `r list_functions("^to_")`

Reformatting means changing the format of the network,
e.g. from directed to undirected via `to_undirected()`.
Transforming means changing the dimensions of the network,
e.g. from a two-mode network to a one-mode projection via `to_mode1()`.
Splitting means separating a network,
e.g. from a whole network to the various ego networks via `to_egos()`.
Those functions that split a network into a list of networks are
distinguishable as those `to_*()` functions that are named in the plural.

### Marks

`{manynet}` offers a range of measures and models with sensible defaults.
Many wrap existing functions in common packages for use with one-mode networks,
but extend these to treat and/or normalise for two-mode (and sometimes three-mode) networks correctly.
Functions are given intuitive and succinct names that avoid conflicts 
with existing function names wherever possible.

`{manynet}`'s `*is_*()` functions offer fast logical tests of various properties.
Whereas `is_*()` returns a single logical value for the network,
`node_is_*()` returns a logical vector the length of the number of nodes in the network,
and `tie_is_*()` returns a logical vector the length of the number of ties in the network.

- `r list_functions("^is_")`
- `r list_functions("^node_is_")`
- `r list_functions("^tie_is_")`

The `*is_max()` and `*is_min()` functions are used to identify
the maximum or minimum, respectively, node or tie according to some measure (see below).

## Installation

### Stable

The easiest way to install the latest stable version of `{manynet}` is via CRAN.
Simply open the R console and enter:

`install.packages('manynet')`

You can then begin to use `{manynet}` by loading the package:

`library(manynet)`

This will load any required packages and make the data contained within the package available.
The version from CRAN also has all the vignettes built and included.
You can check them out with:

`vignettes(package = "manynet")`

### Development

For the latest development version, 
for slightly earlier access to new features or for testing,
you may wish to download and install the binaries from Github
or install from source locally.

The latest binary releases for all major OSes -- Windows, Mac, and Linux -- 
can be found [here](https://github.com/snlab-ch/manynet/releases/latest).
Download the appropriate binary for your operating system,
and install using an adapted version of the following commands:

- For Windows: `install.packages("~/Downloads/manynet_winOS.zip", repos = NULL)`
- For Mac: `install.packages("~/Downloads/manynet_macOS.tgz", repos = NULL)`
- For Unix: `install.packages("~/Downloads/manynet_linuxOS.tar.gz", repos = NULL)`

To install from source the latest main version of `{manynet}` from Github, 
please install the `{remotes}` or `{devtools}` package from CRAN and then:

- For latest stable version: 
`remotes::install_github("snlab-ch/manynet", build_vignettes = TRUE)`
- For latest development version: 
`remotes::install_github("snlab-ch/manynet@develop", build_vignettes = TRUE)`

## Relationship to other packages

This package aims to provide an updated, and more comprehensive replacement for `{intergraph}`.
It also builds upon but makes some different decisions to the excellent `{tidygraph}` package.

## Funding details

Subsequent work on this package has been funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)
[Grant Number 188976](https://data.snf.ch/grants/grant/188976): 
"Power and Networks and the Rate of Change in Institutional Complexes" (PANARCHIC).

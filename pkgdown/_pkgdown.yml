      Functions for constructing, simulating, and importing
      directed and undirected, one-mode and two-mode networks
      into whichever class of object is desired for further analysis.

      Functions for coercing objects between different classes, 
      reformatting or transforming the type of network,
      or adding information to or retrieving information from the network.

      Functions for identifying properties of networks, nodes, or ties.
      All `node_` and `tie_` measures return a single vector.
      `network_` measures return one or, in some cases of two-mode measures,
      two values.
      The `is_*()` family all return logical scalars (TRUE or FALSE).

      The package contains a variety of networks useful for pedagogical purposes
      and used in the course 'Social Networks Theories and Methods' and other workshops.
      Each page documents the source of the data and its format.

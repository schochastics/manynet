      Functions for constructing, simulating, and importing
      directed and undirected, one-mode and two-mode networks
      into whichever class of object is desired for further analysis.

      Functions for manipulating networks into useful formats.
      This includes functions for reformatting networks into networks
      of the same dimensions but a different type, e.g. from directed to undirected.
      It also includes functions for transforming networks into networks
      with other dimensions, such as from a two-mode network into a one-mode network.
      There are also functions for splitting networks, e.g. into a list of ego networks,
      and rejoining them from such lists.
      There are also tidy-style and igraph-style functions for adding or joining
      new data on nodes or ties to networks.

      Functions for identifying properties of networks, nodes, or ties.
      All `node_` and `tie_` measures return a single vector.
      `network_` measures return one or, in some cases of two-mode measures,
      two values.
      The `is_*()` family all return logical scalars (TRUE or FALSE).

      The package contains a variety of networks useful for pedagogical purposes
      and used in the course 'Social Networks Theories and Methods' and other workshops.
      Each page documents the source of the data and its format.
      References are provided for further reading and citation.

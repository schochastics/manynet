      Functions for identifying properties of graphs, nodes or ties,
      all returning logical scalars or vectors.
      Note that all `node_` and `tie_` measures return a single vector
      so that they can be added directly to graph objects.
      `network_` measures return one or, in some cases of two-mode measures,
      two values.

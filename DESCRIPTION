Package: manynet
Title: Many Ways to Make, Modify, Mark, and Map Myriad Networks
Version: 0.5.0
Date: 2024-05-23
Description: A set of tools for making, modifying, marking, and mapping many different types of networks.
   All functions operate with matrices, edge lists, and 'igraph', 'network', and 'tidygraph' objects,
   and on one-mode, two-mode (bipartite), and sometimes three-mode networks.
   The package includes functions for importing and exporting, creating and generating networks,
   modifying networks and node and tie attributes,
   and describing and visualizing networks with sensible defaults.

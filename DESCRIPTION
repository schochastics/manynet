Title: Tools for Working with Many Different Types of Networks
Version: 0.0.1
Date: 2023-04-11
Description: A set of tools for analysing many different types of networks.
   All functions operate with matrices, edge lists, 
   and 'igraph', 'network', and 'tidygraph' objects,
   and on one-mode, two-mode (bipartite), and sometimes three-mode networks.
   The package is released as a complement to 
   'Multimodal Political Networks' (2021, ISBN:9781108985000).

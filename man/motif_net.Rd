\usage{
net_by_dyad(.data)

net_by_triad(.data)

net_by_tetrad(.data)

net_by_mixed(.data, object2)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{An object of a manynet-consistent class:
\itemize{
\item matrix (adjacency or incidence) from \code{{base}} R
\item edgelist, a data frame from \code{{base}} R or tibble from \code{{tibble}}
\item igraph, from the \code{{igraph}} package
\item network, from the \code{{network}} package
\item tbl_graph, from the \code{{tidygraph}} package
}}

\item{object2}{A second, two-mode migraph-consistent object.}
}
\description{
These functions include ways to take a census of the positions of nodes
in a network:
\itemize{
\item \code{net_by_dyad()} returns a census of dyad motifs in a network.
\item \code{net_by_triad()} returns a census of triad motifs in a network.
\item \code{net_by_tetrad()} returns a census of tetrad motifs in a network.
\item \code{net_by_mixed()} returns a census of triad motifs that span
a one-mode and a two-mode network.
}
}
\section{Tetrad census}{

The tetrad census counts the number of four-node configurations in the network.
The function returns a matrix with a special naming convention:
\itemize{
\item E4 (aka co-K4): This is an empty set of four nodes; no ties
\item I4 (aka co-diamond): This is a set of four nodes with just one tie
\item H4 (aka co-C4): This set of four nodes includes two non-adjacent ties
\item L4 (aka co-paw): This set of four nodes includes two adjacent ties
\item D4 (aka co-claw): This set of four nodes includes three adjacent ties,
in the form of a triangle with one isolate
\item U4 (aka P4, four-actor line): This set of four nodes includes three ties
arranged in a line
\item Y4 (aka claw): This set of four nodes includes three ties all adjacent
to a single node
\item P4 (aka paw, kite): This set of four nodes includes four ties arranged
as a triangle with an extra tie hanging off of one of the nodes
\item C4 (aka bifan): This is a symmetric box or 4-cycle or set of shared choices
\item Z4 (aka diamond): This resembles C4 but with an extra tie cutting across the box
\item X4 (aka K4): This resembles C4 but with two extra ties cutting across the box;
a realisation of all possible ties

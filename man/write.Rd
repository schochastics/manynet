\title{Making networks to external files}
\source{
\code{write_ucinet()} kindly supplied by Christian Steglich,
constructed on 18 June 2015.
}
\usage{
write_matrix(.data, filename, name, ...)

write_edgelist(.data, filename, name, ...)

write_nodelist(.data, filename, name, ...)

write_pajek(.data, filename, ...)

write_ucinet(.data, filename, name)

write_graphml(.data, filename, name, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{An object of a manynet-consistent class:
\itemize{
\item matrix (adjacency or incidence) from \code{{base}} R
\item edgelist, a data frame from \code{{base}} R or tibble from \code{{tibble}}
\item igraph, from the \code{{igraph}} package
\item network, from the \code{{network}} package
\item tbl_graph, from the \code{{tidygraph}} package
}}

\item{filename}{UCINET filename (without ## extension).
By default the files will have the same name as the object
and be saved to the working directory.}

\item{name}{name of matrix to be known in UCINET.
By default the name will be the same as the object.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters passed to the write function.}

\item{file}{A character string with the system path to the file to import.
If left unspecified, an OS-specific file picker is opened to help users select it.
Note that in \code{read_ucinet()} the file path should be to the header file (.##h),
if it exists and that it is currently not possible to import multiple
networks from a single UCINET file. Please convert these one by one.}
}
\value{
The \code{write_}functions export to different file formats,
depending on the function.

A pair of UCINET files in V6404 file format (.##h, .##d)
}
\description{
Researchers may want to save or work with networks outside R.
The following functions offer ways to export to some common external
file formats:
\itemize{
\item \code{write_matrix()} exports an adjacency matrix to a .csv file.
\item \code{write_edgelist()} exports an edgelist to a .csv file.
\item \code{write_nodelist()} exports a nodelist to a .csv file.
\item \code{write_pajek()} exports Pajek .net files.
\item \code{write_ucinet()} exports a pair of UCINET files in V6404 file format (.##h, .##d).
\item \code{write_graphml()} exports GraphML files.
}
}
\details{
Note that these functions are not as actively maintained as others
in the package, so please let us know if any are not currently working
for you or if there are missing import routines
by \href{https://github.com/snlab-ch/manynet/issues}{raising an issue on Github}.

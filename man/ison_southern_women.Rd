\description{
Two-mode network dataset collected by Davis, Gardner and Gardner (1941)
about the pattern of a group of women's participation
at informal social events in Old City during a 9 month period,
as reported in the \emph{Old City Herald} in 1936.
By convention, the nodes are named by the women's first names
and the code numbers of the events,
but the women's surnames and titles (Miss, Mrs.) are recorded here too.
The events' dates are recorded in place of the Surname,
and these dates are also offered as a tie attribute.

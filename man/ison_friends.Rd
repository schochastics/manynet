\description{
One-mode network collected by \href{https://github.com/keithmcnulty/friends_analysis/}{McNulty (2020)}
on the connections between the Friends TV series characters
from Seasons 1 to 10.
The \code{ison_friends} is a directed network
containing connections between characters organised by season number,
which is reflected in the tie attribute 'wave'.
The network contains 650 nodes
Each tie represents the connection between a character pair (appear in the same scene),
and the 'weight' of the tie is the number of scenes the character pair appears in together.
For all networks, characters are named (eg. Phoebe, Ross, Rachel).
}
\details{
The data contains both networks but each may be used separately.

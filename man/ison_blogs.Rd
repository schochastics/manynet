\description{
This network consists of the blogosphere around the time of the 2004
US presidential election until February 2005.
Ties were constructed from a crawl of the front page of each blog.

Political leaning is indicated as "Liberal" (or left leaning) or
"Conservative" (or right leaning), sourced from blog directories.
Some blogs were labelled manually,
based on incoming and outgoing links and posts.

\description{
This network consists of books about US politics sold by Amazon.com.
Ties represent books that are often purchased together,
as revealed by Amazon's 'customers who bought this book also bought these other
books' section on those books' pages on the website.

Information about the book's leaning "Liberal", "Neutral", or "Conservative"
were added separately by Mark Newman based on the abstracts, descriptions,
and reviews posted on Amazon.

\description{
One-mode network dataset collected by Lazega (2001)
on the relations between partners in a corporate law firm called SG&R in New England 1988-1991.
This particular subset includes the 36 partners among the 71 attorneys of this firm.
Nodal attributes include seniority, formal status, office in which they work, gender, lawschool they attended,
their age, and how many years they had been at the firm.
}
\details{
The larger data from which this subset comes includes also individual performance measurements (hours worked, fees brought in)
and attitudes concerning various management policy options (see also \code{{sand}}),
their strong-coworker network, advice network, friendship network, and indirect control network.

\description{
One-mode network dataset collected by Gabasova (2016)
on the interactions between Star Wars characters in each movie from
Episode 1 ("The Phantom Menace") to Episode 7 ("The Force Awakens").

Characters are named (eg. R2-D2, Anakin, Chewbacca)
and the following node attributes are provided where available:
height, mass, hair color, skin color, eye color, birth year, sex, homeworld, and species.
The node attribute 'faction' has also been added,
denoting the faction (eg. Jedi, Rebel Alliance, etc)
that Star Wars characters belong to in each episode
(coding completed with help of Yichen Shen and Tiphaine Aeby).

Weighted ties represent the number of times characters speak
within the same scene of each film, indicated by the wave (1-7).

Change in the composition of the network is tracked by the variable 'active',
though several other variables also change
(mostly as Anakin becomes \emph{spoiler alert}).
}
\details{
The network for each episode may be extracted and used separately,
eg. \code{ison_starwars[[1]]} or \verb{ison_starwars$Episode I} for Episode 1.

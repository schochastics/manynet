\usage{
to_matching(.data, mark = "type")

to_mentoring(.data, elites = 0.1)

to_eulerian(.data)

to_tree(.data)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{An object of a manynet-consistent class:
\itemize{
\item matrix (adjacency or incidence) from \code{{base}} R
\item edgelist, a data frame from \code{{base}} R or tibble from \code{{tibble}}
\item igraph, from the \code{{igraph}} package
\item network, from the \code{{network}} package
\item tbl_graph, from the \code{{tidygraph}} package
}}

\item{mark}{A logical vector marking two types or modes.
By default "type".}

\item{elites}{The proportion of nodes to be selected as mentors.
By default this is set at 0.1.
This means that the top 10\% of nodes in terms of degree,
or those equal to the highest rank degree in the network,
whichever is the higher, will be used to select the mentors.

Note that if nodes are equidistant from two mentors,
they will choose one at random.
If a node is without a path to a mentor,
for example because they are an isolate,
a tie to themselves (a loop) will be created instead.
Note that this is a different default behaviour than that
described in Valente and Davis (1999).}
}
\value{
All \code{to_} functions return an object of the same class as that provided.
So passing it an igraph object will return an igraph object
and passing it a network object will return a network object,
with certain modifications as outlined for each function.
}
\description{
These functions offer tools for transforming manynet-consistent objects
(matrices, igraph, tidygraph, or network objects).
Transforming means that the returned object may have different dimensions
than the original object.
\itemize{
\item \code{to_matching()} transforms a network into one with only matching ties.
\item \code{to_mentoring()} transforms a network where each node is connected only to their closest mentor.
\item \code{to_eulerian()} transforms a network into one that only contains any Eulerian path within it.
\item \code{to_tree()} transforms the network into a spanning tree or, if unconnected, a forest of spanning trees.

\section{\code{to_matching()}}{

\code{to_matching()} uses \code{{igraph}}'s \code{max_bipartite_match()}
to return a network in which each node is only tied to
one of its previous ties.
The number of these ties left is its \emph{cardinality},
and the algorithm seeks to maximise this such that,
where possible, each node will be associated with just one
node in the other mode or some other mark.
The algorithm used is the push-relabel algorithm
with greedy initialization and a global relabelling
after every \eqn{\frac{n}{2}} steps,
where \eqn{n} is the number of nodes in the network.

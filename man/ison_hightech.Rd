\description{
21 managers of a company of just over 100 employees manufactured high-tech equipment
on the west coast of the United States.
Three types of ties were collected:
\itemize{
\item \emph{friends}: managers' answers to the question "Who is your friend?"
\item \emph{advice}: managers' answers to the question "To whom do you go to for advice?"
\item \emph{reports}: "To whom do you report?" based on company reports
}

The data is anonymised, but four nodal attributes are included:
\itemize{
\item \emph{age}: the manager's age in years
\item \emph{tenure}: the manager's length of service
\item \emph{level}: the manager's level in the corporate hierarchy,
where 3 = CEO, 2 = Vice President, and 1 = manager
\item \emph{dept}: one of four departments, B, C, D, E,
with the CEO alone in A
}
